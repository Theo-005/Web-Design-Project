					<h3 class="ls_p title">Clean Energy</h3>
				    <p class="ls_p">To understand clean energy, we focused on information about how modern cities rely heavily on electricity and other forms of power to function. We discovered that disasters often damage power stations, roads and basic services, making cities vulnerable when something goes wrong. This helped us see why clean, renewable energy sources — like solar or wind — are important for creating reliable and sustainable city systems. We also learned that switching to clean energy requires careful planning, long-term funding and strong support from local governments. By connecting these ideas with what we learned about urban growth, we saw how clean energy plays a key role in building safer and more sustainable cities.</p>

					<h3 class="ls_p title">Clean Travel</h3>
				    <p class="ls_p">To learn about clean travel, we started by looking at how quickly cities around the world are growing and how this puts pressure on transportation systems. Many cities don’t have enough buses, trains or safe walking and biking paths, which leads to traffic jams, pollution and long, uncomfortable commutes. By studying global reports on urban development, we learned that improving public transport is not just about getting people from one place to another — it’s also about making travel cleaner, safer and more affordable. This research helped us understand why cities need better planning and investment to create travel options that are good for both people and the environment.</p>

					<h3 class="ls_p title">Reduced Carbon Emissions</h3>
				    <p class="ls_p">When researching ways to reduce carbon emissions, we explored how city growth leads to more energy use, more buildings and more vehicles — all of which add to pollution. We found information showing that many cities struggle with problems like overcrowding and weak local governance, which make it harder to control emissions. We also looked at how better planning, such as creating affordable housing close to jobs and improving public services, can help reduce the amount of carbon cities produce. The data on disasters damaging infrastructure also showed us that cities need strong, resilient systems to handle environmental challenges. Altogether, this helped us understand how smarter city planning can make a big difference in lowering carbon emissions.</p>

					<h3 class="ls_p title">Heritage Protection</h3>
				    <p class="ls_p">For heritage protection, we researched how countries fund the care of important cultural and historical places, such as monuments, museums and natural sites. We found that while some countries invest a lot of money to protect these places, others struggle to provide even basic funding. This creates big differences in how well heritage sites are maintained and whether they can survive future challenges like urban development or natural disasters. By studying the data, we learned that protecting heritage is not just about preserving old buildings — it’s also about keeping cultural identity alive for future generations. This helped us understand why cities need to include heritage protection in their planning and provide enough resources to safeguard these irreplaceable sites.</p>
